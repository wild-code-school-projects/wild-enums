# Objective Summary

## Challenge

You will create an enumeration (enum) to represent different colors managed in the application. The enum should include RED, BLUE, GREEN, and YELLOW.

Next, create a `User` class with a first name, last name, and color.

In the console, instantiate a list of several users with different colors and display their information. Ensure that the color is displayed correctly using a description.

Then, display the number of users corresponding to each color. It's not necessary to use the description of the color here; you can display something like `RED: 2 users`.
